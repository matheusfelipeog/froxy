## The goal

This project aims to provide an interface for filter and using free proxies in your web scraping and web crawler projects with Python and [requests module](https://github.com/psf/requests).


## How it works?

Froxy uses the API available at **[Proxy List](https://github.com/clarketm/proxy-list)** and runs a filter to obtain only proxies and their information. Then it provides an interface to filter and use the filtered proxies.

### Why are you using this API?

- It free.
- No query limit.
- It provides proxies that work well.
- It has a variety of types of proxies.
- It has an interesting amount of proxies.
- It is updated daily.

Thank you for maintaining and making this API available [@clarketm](https://github.com/clarketm) ‚ù§
